# Pawsibilities
Petful assignment, built by Anugrah Lambogo and Maggie McClellan

Cat and dog lovers, gather 'round! The newest member of your family can't wait to meet you. Pawsibilities is a web app that allows users to adopt a cat or dog (*disclaimer: this is all virtual; no actual adoptions are available through this site!). Join the queue of hopeful adopters, and when it's your turn, click on a dog or cat to select the pet you'd like to take home.
